This is multiple console applications using arrays. Each application has its own section and is commented out. Here is a list of each application in order:

1. Takes 10 numbers and displays them in a list in the order they were entered. 
2. Takes 5 numbers and displays the average of those numbers and all numbers entered that were greater than the average. 
3. Takes 10 numbers and displays how many times the "Target value" was entered.
